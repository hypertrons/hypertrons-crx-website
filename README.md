## What is Hypercrx?

`Hypercrx` project aims at tracing, digging and gaining insight into the projects and developers you're interested in. We do this by inserting useful dashboards into `GitHub` pages. `Hypertrons-crx` provides an effective way for digital operations and analysis of open source community.

## Dashboards ðŸ”¥

You can find these dashboards in:

## How to Contribute

### Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hypertrons/hypertrons-crx
cd hypertrons-crx
npm install
npm run watch
npm run web-ext
```

[web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) would open `Chrome` and load `Hypertrons-crx` into the browser automatically. And the default configuration of `web-ext` can be found in [package.json](https://github.com/hypertrons/hypertrons-crx/blob/master/package.json):

```json
{
  "webExt": {
    "sourceDir": "distribution",
    "run": {
      "keepProfileChanges": true,
      "chromiumProfile": "./test/web-ext-profile",
      "startUrl": ["https://github.com/hypertrons/hypertrons-crx"]
    }
  }
}
```
